https://abhijithvijayan.in

The latest iteration of my personal site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```sh
   yarn run dev
   ```

## üõ† Building and Running for Production

In addition to the development server started with `yarn run dev`, you can also generate a full static production build with next.js static exports and serve that to preview the site as it will appear once deployed:

```sh
yarn serve
```
